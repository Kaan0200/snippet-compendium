## a.k.a's Snippet Compendium

A collection of recipies, code snippits, commands, and guides that I have put together for languages, technologies, and systems.
These are mostly to help me with specific behaviors, or with technologies that I do not touch very often, or have specific 'gatchas' I need to get past, or are complex reusable recipes.
